# iOS Framework Builder
This project has been inspired a great deal by [Jeff Verkoeyen's iOS Framework](https://github.com/jverkoey/iOS-Framework) guide. Many thanks Jeff.

This is basically a ruby port of his shell script. I ran into problem with his guide when apple released the 64 bit platforms -- specifically needing to support 32 bit and 64 bit simulators with the same `.framework` bundle.

See the [howto guide](HOWTO.md) to get started. This will guide you through the steps necessary add the build script to your project.
